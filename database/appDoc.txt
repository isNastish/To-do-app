Alex TO_DO console APP , version (1.0.1), was released <10.08.2020>.
In that app we can store different data, such as global data which would be 
stored in a .bin file, global means your long-term plans on future, and short 
tasks on a current day, which you can add, delete, mark as done, mark as rejected etc.
All data will be stored in special binary files.
In future it will be ported to windows.



                            Available flags for command line
